# Smart Waste Classification using YOLOv10

This project demonstrates the use of a trained YOLOv10 model to classify objects as **biodegradable** or **non-biodegradable**. Originally designed for real-time waste segregation via camera, this version is simplified for code sharing and deployment purposes.
